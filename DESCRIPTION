Description: Fit Bayesian multivariate GARCH models using 'Stan' for full Bayesian inference. Currently DCC(P,Q), CCC(P,Q), and BEKK(P,Q) parameterizations are implemented, based either on a multivariate gaussian normal or student-t distribution. The fitted models are rstan objects and can be passed examined with rstan functions.
